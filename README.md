# Buzzer

A little buzzer app for running your own quizzes or game shows! Uses websockets to sent messages.

This fork adds a package-lock.json and plays a sound using SoX's `play` (included beep.mp3 from [Mike Kroenig on SoundBible](http://soundbible.com/1540-Computer-Error-Alert.html)

## Running the app

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run this
application. For Node:

```
npm install
node index.js
```

For Docker:

```
docker build -t buzzer .
docker run -p 8090:8090 buzzer
```

Open http://localhost:8090 in your browser to start!

## How to use

The players goto the homepage (`http://localhost:8090/`) and they can enter their name and team
number. Joining will give them a giant buzzer button!

The host heads over to `/host` and will be able to see everyone that buzzes in and clear the list
in between questions:
